    <h2 >REFLECTIVE DISCUSSION</h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The objective of this project was to design and develop a responsive portfolio using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). The project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in HTML coding techniques and understanding of responsive design principles to ensure the website's compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.</p>
        
        <h2>DESIGN DECISION:</h2>
        <p>The layout's colour scheme was decided upon by consulting the website REALTIME COLOURS. Before settling on the final colours, colours were experimented with on this website (Justopped 2023) Making decisions was made simple by visualising the colours and experimenting with them on the website. Thanks to the use of keyframes, animation, and various transitions, the website is simple to navigate on all screens. When a user visits a website, they initially see the home page.  .</p>
        
        <h2>Implementation:</h2>
        <p>The website was structured using HTML5 markup, adhering to semantic HTML practices for improved accessibility and SEO. The layout was designed with responsiveness in mind, utilizing CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and media queries to adjust the layout based on screen size. Conclusion: In conclusion, this project enabled the application of HTML coding skills to develop a responsive portfolio. By implementing semantic HTML and responsive design techniques, the website offers an engaging user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, meeting the project objectives effectively. Future enhancements could include integration with server-side technologies for dynamic content management and further optimization for performance and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>UPS AND DOWNS:</h2>
    
        <p>I was able to grasp the fundamentals of web development and designing websites in this subject by bringing concepts to life.I discovered the usefulness of grids throughout this project; I was able to use them for my cards and other portions of the portfoil, but in some places, like the contact page, flex was utilised instead of the CSS grid. </p>
